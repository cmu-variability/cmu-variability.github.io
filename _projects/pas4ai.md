title: Preparing Autistic Students for the AI Workforce

description: |
 We teach AI, communication, and teamwork skills to autistic community college students in a 10-week  online course. Afterwards, we facilitate our students to obtain AI-focused summer internships where they can practice what they learned and increase their access to AI careers. We use a strengths-based approach to provide strategies and supports that allow individuals with autism to engage confidently, competently, and with a positive sense of self when navigating the complex and challenging social environment of the workplace. This is a collaboration with [SureStart](https://mysurestart.com), an AI-focused education startup.
