subtitle: Gesture and Gaze Recognition for Accessible Collaborative Environments

description: 
   Sighted people generally used visual and pointing references to indicate areas of interest when speaking to collaborators. However, blind and low vision people cannot understand these references. This leads to miscommunication, impeding their ability to pay attention to the same things and preventing effective and efficient collaboration. The GRACE project combines gaze and gesture recognition to locate areas of interests and identify the objects on the screen they may be referencing. Our system converts these references into a written form suitable to be announced via screen reader, thereby reducing the burden for blind and low vision users to locate the referenced object.

**Gesture and Gaze Recognition for Accessible Collaborative Environments (GRACE)**

---

## Background

**Challenge:** 
- Sighted people often rely on visual cues (e.g., pointing/using spatial references) to indicate areas of interest during screen-based discussions. However, blind and low-vision individuals cannot perceive these references, leading to difficulties in shared attention. The GRACE project (Gaze and Gesture Recognition for Accessible Communication and Engagement) addresses this by developing a system that uses gaze and gesture data to infer which screen object is being referenced.

## Model

**Solution:** 
- GRACE integrates computer vision, natural language processing, and assistive output to translate non-verbal visual cues into accessible descriptions. When a user gestures or gazes at part of the screen during a conversation, our system captures that input and infers which interface element is being referenced.
