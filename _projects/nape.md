title: Neurodiversity-Aware Platform for Education (NAPE)
subtitle: An accessible and inclusive platform for eliminating cognitive barriers in pedagogical material
description: |
  The NAPE project aims to improve the accessibility of educational materials by adapting them to the cognitive styles of individuals, including those with ADHD, dyslexia, and autism. It seeks to create an inclusive learning environment by removing traditional learning barriers.

**Neurodiversity-Aware Platform for Education (NAPE)** aims to enhance comprehension and retention by tailoring educational materials to diverse cognitive styles, making learning more accessible to all.

---

## Background

- **Challenge:** Educational materials often assume uniform cognitive approaches, creating barriers for neurodiverse learners. Attention difficulties, slower processing speeds, or sequencing challenges are prevalent among learners with ADHD, dyslexia, and autism.

- **Our Solution:** Customizable educational materials designed to improve comprehension and retention across diverse learners.

---

## Segmentation Algorithm

- We developed a unique segmentation algorithm which inserts a **4-second pause** in the video whenever a step occurs in pre-recorded instructional material for block-based programming (e.g., clicking on a block, dragging an item, or explaining a concept within Scratch).

- These pauses allow learners to process each step, reducing cognitive load and enhancing task performance.

## ICER Paper

- In summer 2024, we conducted a study which examined ADHD learners' interaction with segmented vs. traditional instructional videos.

- Performance metrics included errors, hesitations, and task completion time.

- **Key Findings:** Segmented learning improves comprehension and reduces cognitive overload among ADHD participants.

## AI Development

- NAPE uses AI to adapt educational content based on user behavior and learning preferences.

- **AI Capabilities:** This AI algorithm analyzes engagement patterns to offer adaptive feedback tailored to each learner's strengths and needs.
