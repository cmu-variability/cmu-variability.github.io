title: Collaboration Station

description: |
  We are developing web-based, block-based IDE based on [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) that supports synchronous co-editing with Zoom-enabled collaboration. We use this IDE in our yearly [EdASE](https://edase.org) summer video game coding camp for autistic high school students.
