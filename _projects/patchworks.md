title: Patchworks


description: |
  We are exploring how developers use, understand, and make decisions about patches during debugging tasks to help developers fix bugs, fast. Though tools that automatically fix programs are becoming more effective, they are unable to fix many types of bugs and have the potential to create patches which may look correct, but aren’t. As a result, humans are essential to the debugging task and they must review and edit patches created by tools before applying them. Successful strategies people use when debugging with patches remain less studied, and decisions about patch correctness can be difficult. With an understanding of developers’ strategies when using machine-made patches, we will be able to more effectively build usable  repair tools and intervene when debugging goes wrong.
