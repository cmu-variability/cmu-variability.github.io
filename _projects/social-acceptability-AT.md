title: Socially Acceptable Assistive Technology 

description: |
 Despite their advanced functionality, much of assistive technology (AT) is rejected or abandoned by individuals with disabilities. We explore how AT can influence the social standing and elicit stigma, and propose designing for systems to fit users' social contexts. Our current focus is on developing ADHD-centered executive functioning support tools (ACES).
