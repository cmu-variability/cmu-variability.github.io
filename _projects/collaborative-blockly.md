title: Collaborative Blockly

description: |
  We are enhancing Google's [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly) programming environment with functionality to create virtual spaces where autistic youth can learn to work with others through scaffolded, supportive interactions. Our system will help them manage how and when they interact with each other, for example by building collaboration skills in stages in which they can code in the same project but maintain a carefully scaffolded separation of effort. This will ease the coordination skills required to simultaneously edit code with one another and scaffold the social interactions required to integrate independent work into a shared project.
